# Infinity Works Data Test - Starter Project

### Prerequisites
#### Java JDK 8

Go to https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html   
and under the section "Java SE Development Kit 8u191" (the final digits may vary at the time you're reading this)
click the `Accept License Agreement` radio button and download the version appropriate to your operating system.

#### Python 3.6.* or later.
 
See installation instructions at: https://www.python.org/downloads/
 
Check you have python3 installed:
```bash
python3 --version
```

#### Preferably an IDE such as Pycharm Community Edition

https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/


### Dependencies and data

#### Creating a virtual environment

Ensure your pip (package manager) is up to date:
```bash
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```
 
To check your pip version run:
```bash
pip3 --version
```
 
Install virtualenv:
```bash
pip3 install virtualenv
```
 
Create the virtual environment in the root of the cloned project:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

#### Activating the newly created virtual environment
 
You always want your virtual environment to be active when working on this project.
 
```bash
source ./.venv/bin/activate 
```

#### Installing Python requirements

This will install some of the packages you might find useful:  
```bash
pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt 
```

#### Running tests to ensure everything is working correctly

```bash
pytest ./tests
```

#### Generating the data

A data generator is included as part of the project in `./input_data_generator/main_data_generator.py`
This allows you to generate a configurable number of months of data.
Although the technical test specification mentions 6 months of data, it's best to generate
less than that initially to help improve the debugging process.

To run the data generator use:
```bash
python ./input_data_generator/main_data_generator.py
```

This should produce customers, products and transaction data under `./input_data/starter`


#### Getting started

The skeleton of a possible solution is provided in `./solution/solution_start.py`
You do not have to use this code if you want to approach the problem in a different way.
